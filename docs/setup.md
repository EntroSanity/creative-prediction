This page will show you how to set up your computer to follow along with the examples in the CrePre workshop. 

All of our code examples are provided as [Python 3](https://www.python.org) code in [jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org).

## Running examples on your computer

Basically: you need a Python 3 environment with up-to-date versions of: Keras, Tensorflow, NumPy, Pandas, MatplotLib, Music21, Jupyter.

## Running examples in a browser

You can also (potentially) run these notebooks on Google Colaboratory ([colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com)), an online Jupyter notebook system that could be useful, however, it's a bit more tricky to distribute the jupyter notebooks so that you can easily open them in Colab. Try storing the notebooks (`ipynb` files from the Github Repo) in your Google Drive and opening them, they should start up a colab instance.
