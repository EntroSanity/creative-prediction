Here's a list of creative prediction tutorials available right now!

- **Generating Creative Sequences**
    - Generating Text with a CharRNN; inventing Star Trek episode titles. ([see Notebook 1](https://github.com/cpmpercussion/creative-prediction/blob/master/notebooks/1-star-trek-titles-RNN-basic.ipynb))
    - Advanced CharRNN techniques ([see Notebook 2](https://github.com/cpmpercussion/creative-prediction/blob/master/notebooks/2-star-trek-titles-advanced.ipynb))
    - Continuing musical sequences. ([see Notebook 3](https://github.com/cpmpercussion/creative-prediction/blob/master/notebooks/3-zeldic-musical-RNN.ipynb))
    - Combining multiple sequences in a CharRNN with "Gesture-RNN". ([see Notebook 4](https://github.com/cpmpercussion/creative-prediction/blob/master/notebooks/4-gesture-rnn.ipynb))
- **RNNs for continuous-valued data: Mixture Density Layers (MDNs)**
    - Probability Distributions ([see Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/cpmpercussion/creative-prediction/blob/master/notebooks/mdn-talk-examples.ipynb))
        - comparing continuous and categorical probability distributions
        - modelling data with a normal distribution
        - modelling data with a mixture of normal distributions
    - Introduction to Mixture Density Layers ([see Notebook 5](https://github.com/cpmpercussion/creative-prediction/blob/master/notebooks/5-mdn-sine-prediction.ipynb))
    - Predicting sketching: Kanji generation with a Mixture Density RNN. ([see Notebook 6](https://github.com/cpmpercussion/creative-prediction/blob/master/notebooks/6-MDN-RNN-kanji-generation.ipynb))
    - Predicting time and place - musical scribbles with RoboJam. ([see Notebook 7](https://github.com/cpmpercussion/creative-prediction/blob/master/notebooks/7-MDN-Robojam-touch-generation.ipynb))

<!-- 
The [ALife schedule is now published!](http://2018.alife.org/schedule/) and this CREative PREdiction ("CREPRE") tutorial will occur on Monday 23 July in two sessions: 11:30am-12:45pm and 16:15pm-17:30pm. The sessions will cover different material, but feel free to come to either or both if you want! The list of topics is below. -->

- **Introduction to Predictive Interaction (15 minutes)**
    - Overview of Deep Learning and Creativity.
    - What is a Recurrent Neural Network?
    - Sequence learning, classification, and training
    - Temporal and non-temporal models.
    - Forward models and bio-inspired prediction.
- **Generating Creative Sequences (60 minutes)**
    - RNNs and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with Keras and Python.
    - Generating Text with a CharRNN; inventing Star Trek episode titles. ([see Notebook 1](https://github.com/cpmpercussion/creative-prediction/blob/master/notebooks/1-star-trek-titles-RNN-basic.ipynb))

- **Interacting with RNNs (15 minutes)**
    - Introduction to the Neural iPad Ensemble, and Robojam, two projects showing how RNNs can be used in interactive-creativity systems.
- **RNNs for continuous-valued data: Mixture Density Layers (MDNs) (45 minutes)**
    - Introduction to Mixture Density Layers ([see Notebook 5](https://github.com/cpmpercussion/creative-prediction/blob/master/notebooks/5-mdn-sine-prediction.ipynb))
    - Predicting sketching: Kanji generation with a Mixture Density RNN. ([see Notebook 6](https://github.com/cpmpercussion/creative-prediction/blob/master/notebooks/6-MDN-RNN-kanji-generation.ipynb))

- Time for demonstration, interaction, and live-hacking with these systems. (15+ minutes)

TBA: Hopefully we can have a dinner/discussion meet up later on Monday 23/7 or later in the week! It would be great to keep a discussion about CrePre going! -->
