#### Dr. Charles Martin

Charles Martin is an expert in music technology, musical AI, and human computer interaction. His work involves applying ML to creative data to help enhance users’ creativity and enjoyment. Charles is currently a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Oslo working in creative machine learning systems. He holds a PhD in computer science (2016, Australian National Unversity), a masters degree in percussion performance (2012, Luleå University of Technology), and a bachelor’s degree in mathematics (2008). He has performed his own music in Australia, the USA and across Europe, and released several musical apps for iOS devices. Charles’ recent projects include a Neural Network-controlled iPad Ensemble, and RoboJam, a deep learning system that collaborates with smartphone music makers.

#### Assoc. Prof. Kyrre Glette

Kyrre Glette received his M.Sc. in Computer Engineering (2004) from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Norway, and his Ph.D. in Computer Science (2008) from the University of Oslo, Norway. He is currently employed at the University of Oslo as an Associate Professor. His research interests are intelligent, adaptive, and biologically inspired systems, with a focus on embedded and runtime evolvable hardware systems. Another research interest is evolutionary robotics with an emphasis on simulation, design and prototyping of biologically inspired robots.
