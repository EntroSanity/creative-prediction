### Tutorial Description

The goal of this tutorial is to apply predictive machine learning models to creative data. The focus of the tutorial will be recurrent neural networks (RNNs), deep learning models that can be used to generate sequential and temporal data. RNNs can be applied to many kinds of creative data including text and music. They can learn the long-range structure from a corpus of data and "create" new sequences by predicting one element at a time. When embedded in a creative interface, they can be used for "predictive interaction" where a human collaborates with, influences, and is influenced by a generative neural network.

We will walk through the fundamental steps for training creative RNNs with the participants using live-coded demonstrations with Python code in Jupyter Notebooks. These steps are: collecting and cleaning data, building and training an RNN, and developing predictive interactions.

Our demonstrations will be motivated from examples from our own research in creativity support tools. We will show how streams of interaction data from a creative musical interface can be modelled with deep recurrent neural networks (RNNs). From this data, we can predict users' future interactions, or the potential interactions of other users. This enables us to "fill in" parts of a iPad-based musical ensemble when other users are not available, or to continue a user's composition with new musical layers. 

This session will be interactive. The participants will be provided with demonstration code at the beginning of the session that they can run on their laptops as we go. Instructions will be provided prior to the tutorial so that participants can setup their systems. We will also have live demonstrations and interactive live-hacking of our creative RNN systems, including RoboJam: a agent for responding to smartphone musical performances, the Neural iPad Ensemble, and the Neural Lever Machine - a physical computing interface to a creative RNN. 

We think that every participant will come out of the tutorial with a custom RNN trained on text or musical data, as well as inspiration to make new creative neural network systems!
