<p>You don’t!</p>
<p>After all, anybody can write anything and put it on the internet.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2019/10/14/ravel_ai_youtube/">happens</a>!</p>
<p>At least if a paper has been <strong>peer-reviewed</strong>, other researchers have also agreed that it is <strong>probably not lies</strong>.</p>

<p>When you <strong>cite</strong> references in your own research, you are building on knowledge.</p>
<p>Your <strong>references section</strong> provides information about <strong>where that knowledge comes from</strong>.</p>
<p>Examiners will <strong>read your reference section</strong>! Why?</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>shows student’s ability to critically engage with knowledge</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>shows student engaging with recent research, cutting edge, and “difficult” sources</p>
  </li>
</ul></section><section id="from-research-to-published-paper"><h2>From research to published paper…</h2>
<p><img src="/assets/authorship/research-authoring-pathway.png" alt=""></p>
<p>There is a pathway from research to a published paper!</p>
<p>All research outputs are valuable, but they have different properties.</p>
<p>Ask yourself: <strong>how do I know this output isn’t lies?</strong></p></section><section id="citing-the-right-paper"><h2>Citing the right paper</h2>
<p>Multiple versions of a paper can exist! How do we cite the right one?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pre-print version on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">arxiv.org</code>
</li>
  <li>Publisher’s version on a journal website (behind paywall!)</li>
  <li>“Post-print” version on university website (often required by law!)</li>
  <li>Version on author’s own website (e.g., <a href="https://charlesmartin.com.au/publications">charlesmartin.com.au/publications</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>As a first preference, <strong>always cite the publisher’s version!</strong> (this is the one that has been peer-reviewed).</p>
<p>If a paper is not published, <strong>cite the ArXiv</strong> or author’s version but remember: it might not be peer-reviewed.</p>
<p><em>Finding</em> the publisher’s version can take some research, particularly for CS conference publications!</p></section><section id="citations"><h2>citations</h2>
<p><img src="/assets/authorship/author-date-citation-apastyle.png" alt="" style="width:50%;float:right;"></p>
<p>A citation is an <strong>accurate</strong> way to find a reference.</p>
<p>Need to include: <strong>what</strong> (title), <strong>who</strong> (authors), <strong>when</strong> (date), <strong>where it came from</strong> (publisher, source), <strong>where to find it</strong> (DOI, URL)</p>
<p><a href="https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/citations/basic-principles/author-date">Image Credit: Author-Date Citation System (APA Style Guidelines)</a></p>
<p>Totally valid to cite blog posts, youtube videos, tweets, etc etc, see the <a href="https://apastyle.apa.org/blog">APA Style Blog</a> for ideas.</p></section><section id="dois-digital-object-identifier"><h2>DOIs (Digital Object Identifier)</h2>
<p>There’s a special kind of URL called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier">“DOI”</a> available for many academic publications. The idea is that the DOI will be unique and never change (unlike URLs).</p>
<p>An example DOI is: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">10.1000/182</code></p>
<p>And we can follow it by going to: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1000/182">https://doi.org/10.1000/182</a></p>
<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">prefix/suffix</code> format identifies the publisher or registrant (prefix) and the specific object (suffix).</p>
<p>DOIs aren’t just for papers! They can be for any piece of data (code, files, videos, images, figures, etc.)</p>
<p><strong>If a DOI is available, use it instead of a URL!</strong></p></section><section id="bibtex"><h2>BibTeX</h2>

<p>Many honours/Masters/research projects can be formulated in an academic paper.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your final paper may not be quite acceptable for publication yet.</li>
  <li>Your supervisor(s) can help you get it up to scratch.</li>
  <li>We can also help you attend a conference to present your work.</li>
  <li>( We would expect to be co-authors of a paper after collaborating on these tasks! :-D )</li>
</ul></section><section id="publishing-a-paper"><h2>Publishing a Paper!</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Academics publish research as part of their job!</li>
  <li>Usually publishing is tied to important stuff: e.g., promotion, funding, number of PhD places, prestige.</li>
  <li>We also LIKE to publish! We want to tell people about our work and want to read about what others are doing!</li>
  <li>PhD students usually have to publish in order to get their degree!</li>
  <li>Publishing can look a bit different between disciplines.</li>
  <li>In computer science we have two main ways to publish:</li>
  <li>Conferences: e.g., International Conference on Machine Learning</li>
  <li>Journals: e.g., IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems</li>
</ul></section><section id="journal"><h2>Journal</h2>
<p><img src="/assets/authorship/journal-production-process.jpg" alt="journal production" style="width:50%;float:right;"></p>
<ol>
  <li>Send a manuscript to the journal when ready.</li>
  <li>1+ rounds of reviewing and changes</li>
  <li>Manuscript is turned into an article by the journal staff</li>
  <li>Published online (sometimes print…)</li>
</ol></section><section id="conference"><h2>Conference</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Submit paper on conference website by a deadline.</li>
  <li>All papers are reviewed at once.</li>
  <li>Usually only one round of review! → accepted or rejected.</li>
  <li>If accepted, polish up paper for “camera ready”</li>
  <li>Attend conference, give talk (10-15mins) or present a poster. Meet other researchers, have a good time.</li>
  <li>Paper appears in the “Proceedings of the Conference” which are published online.</li>
</ul></section><section id="computer-science"><h2>Computer Science</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Conference papers have page limits</li>
  <li>Journal articles tend to be a bit longer</li>
  <li>Most CS academics treat conference papers and journal articles as being equally “worthy” of reading.</li>
  <li>Other fields consider conference papers to be inconsequential or early-stage, will only look at articles and books for serious contributions.</li>
  <li>Normally we would suggest honours/Master students go for a conference paper!</li>
</ul></section><section id="quality-and-competition"><h2>Quality and Competition</h2>
<p>Not all conferences equal!</p>
<p>Acceptance rates:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Difficult conferences &lt; 20% papers accepted</li>
  <li>
    <p>Easier conferences &gt; 50% papers accepted → often focussed on a niche area.</p>
  </li>
  <li>For “prestigious” conferences and journals, there are so many (1000s) submissions, that editors screen out papers that are unlikely to be accepted by reviewers.</li>
  <li>Ranking for conferences tends to be anecdotal.</li>
  <li>Journals often ranked by “Impact Factor”, roughly, “how many citations does the average paper get in one year”</li>
  <li>Academics often consider too much focus on rankings to be harmful.</li>
  <li>But we usually look anyway, as we want evidence that of excellence.</li>
</ul></section><section id="for-you"><h2>For you!</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Do you want to take your research further?</li>
  <li>Do you want to attend a conference?</li>
  <li>
    <p>Submit your paper to a conference!</p>
  </li>
  <li>Requires more revision after deadline.</li>
  <li>Meetings with mentors/supervisors to make sure work is up to scratch.</li>

<ol>
  <li>
<strong>Substantial contributions</strong> to the <strong>conception</strong> or <strong>design</strong> of the work; or the <strong>acquisition</strong>, <strong>analysis</strong>, or <strong>interpretation</strong> of data for the work; AND</li>
  <li>
<strong>Drafting</strong> the work or <strong>revising</strong> it critically for important intellectual content; AND</li>
  <li>
<strong>Final approval</strong> of the version to be published; AND</li>
  <li>
<strong>Agreement to be accountable</strong> for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.</li>
</ol>
<p>All those designated as authors should meet <strong>all four criteria for authorship</strong>, and <strong>all who meet the four criteria should be identified as authors</strong>. Those who do not meet all four criteria should be acknowledged.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>These authorship criteria are intended to reserve the status of authorship for those who <strong>deserve credit</strong> and can take <strong>responsibility</strong> for the work. The criteria are <strong>not intended for use as a means to disqualify colleagues</strong> from authorship who otherwise meet authorship criteria by denying them the opportunity to meet criterion #2 or #3.</p></section><section id="uios-10-commandments-for-ethical-practice-in-research"><h2>UiO’s 10 commandments for ethical practice in research</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Giving authorship credit is free, so I’m relaxed about giving credit to those who have contributed to the research process.</li>
  <li>I tend to have papers with 2-4 authors involved, so it’s easy to make sure that all have a chance to revise the text before submission.</li>
  <li>Could be hands-on editing of the tex file.</li>
  <li>Or marking up a printed out copy of the paper.</li>
  <li>I also write (a few) single author papers; for these, I make clear that it is just me before asking supervisors/mentors to read it.</li>
</ul></section><section id="linking-to-code-data-video-audio"><h1>Linking to Code, Data, Video, Audio</h1>
<p>Can we include a video in a paper? How about code?</p>
<p>Is it enough to include a <em>Dropbox</em> link? What about <em>YouTube</em>?</p>
<p>What happens if <em>YouTube</em> goes out of business?</p>
<p><strong>Websites change, papers should be forever</strong> (or at least a long time…)</p></section><section id="linking-to-code-and-data"><h2>Linking to Code and Data</h2>
<p><img src="/assets/authorship/code-paper.png" alt="" style="width:50%;float:right;"></p>
<p>Becoming more standard these days to link to code or data in a publication. Really good idea:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reproducibility</li>
  <li>More convincing for special application areas (e.g., music, robotics, video)</li>
  <li>Some authors make a “web” version of their paper with videos and interactive stuff: e.g., <a href="https://worldmodels.github.io">https://worldmodels.github.io</a>
